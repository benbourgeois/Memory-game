#THE GAME ROOM

I have decided to create a small site that holds a game of memory or matching. The first page gives a small introduction of what is happening and when you go on to the "GAME" page, the game is there to play. The game itself was made using Javasrcipt and the rest using normal HTML and CSS styling.

#Technologies

Fontawesome

Javascript

HTML5
  Used to create the base of the site
CSS
  Used to create the styles of the site and memory game itself

#Testing

Playing the game too fast:
Go to the game page
Try to click on the different tiles while the others are flipped over
If they do not turn over it is correct and must wait till the others are flipped back over
If you match correctly, you should instantly be able to move to the next attempt to match

Refreshing the page:
Go to the game page
Once you refresh, the game should restart no matter where you are at the game
